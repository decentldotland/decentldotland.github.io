# Decent.Land update #3

## A Decent Land - lore for our first land drop

The [decent.land](https://decent.land) world will be ownable and inhabitable by DAOs, and for that we needed an entire planet building from scratch. In our last update, we shared news that we had appointed Lee Tyrrell as our Art Director, who has since released more lore contributing towards the formation of decent.land's first continent.
