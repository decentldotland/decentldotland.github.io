## Land - spaces for communities to settle in decent.land - is taking shape

Our newly-appointed Art Director, Lee Tyrrell, has been at work designing the specifications for decent.land's collection of Ancient Land NFTs. Far from being a generic drop of incoherent images, the Ancient Lands will be designed adhering to a 'bible' of guidelines. The first installment of lore for decent.land's geography has been published [here](https://leetyrrell.medium.com/a-decent-land-chapter-one-ae611cdd4e08). More lore to come as we move towards a fully-realized planet for DAOs.
