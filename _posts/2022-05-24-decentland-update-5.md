<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;We wandered the shore, and made a remarkable discovery. For maybe two hours the sights were familiar - conches, seaweed, crabs and clams. A set of five monolithic statues was unexpected indeed. Yet, there they stood — amongst the reeds — at the border ‘tween jungle and bay.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/n4XYYBhZZ4">pic.twitter.com/n4XYYBhZZ4</a></p>&mdash; Lee Tyrrell (@GreenT128) <a href="https://twitter.com/GreenT128/status/1525870328953593856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2022</a></blockquote>
